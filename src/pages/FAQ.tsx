      question: "How do the business paths work?",
      answer: "Our business paths are carefully curated walking routes designed for professionals with limited time. Simply select your city, choose your available time (30, 60, or 120 minutes), and we'll provide a detailed route with points of interest, dining recommendations, and cultural highlights."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the paths suitable for all fitness levels?",
      answer: "Yes! Our paths are designed for comfortable walking at a leisurely pace. We include distance information and estimated walking times, and most routes are accessible via public transportation if needed."
    },
    {
      question: "How are the paths curated?",
      answer: "We work with local experts, frequent business travelers, and cultural consultants in each city. Every path is tested multiple times and updated regularly to ensure quality and accuracy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the paths?",
      answer: "Currently, our paths are pre-designed for optimal experience. However, we provide detailed step-by-step directions and highlight alternative stops along the way so you can adapt as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to download an app?",
      answer: "No! Traveler.business works directly in your web browser. You can bookmark paths on your phone for offline reference, and we provide Google Maps integration for navigation."
    },
    {
      question: "How much do the paths cost?",
      answer: "Most path information is free to access. We're exploring premium features for the future, but our core mission is to help business travelers explore cities regardless of budget."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the paths safe?",
      answer: "Safety is our top priority. All paths stick to well-traveled, safe areas and business districts. We avoid isolated areas and provide safety tips for each location."
    },
    {
      question: "What cities are currently available?",
      answer: "We currently offer paths in New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Singapore, and Berlin, with new cities being added regularly. Check our cities page for the most up-to-date list."
    },
    {
      question: "How often are paths updated?",
      answer: "We review and update all paths quarterly, with real-time updates for any major changes like construction, closures, or new attractions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I suggest a new city?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We love hearing from our community. Use our contact form to suggest new cities, and we'll prioritize based on demand and feasibility."
    },
    {
      question: "What if a location is closed when I visit?",
      answer: "Each path includes alternative stops and backup options. We also provide business hours and seasonal information to help you plan accordingly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer group paths?",
      answer: "Our current paths work great for small groups (2-4 people). We're developing specific group features and corporate packages for larger teams."
